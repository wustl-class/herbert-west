      <h1>Custom services for special Canadians</h1>
      <h2>
        There are 1,000,000 ways to landscape a yard. That’s just math.

        We are experts at custom design.

        Landscaping
      </h3>
      <p>
        Typically, when we do a custom design, we listen to the customer’s ideas, combine them with our landscape expertise, and then ignore your stupid ideas so we can get to work and do this thing correctly. We measure how much space you have to work with, and then go over types of material and new and different landscape styles to create the landscape of your dreams.

      <h3>
        Paverstone Paths
      </h3>
      <p>
        Need to create a surface upon which to walk? Paverstone paths are usually made of concrete or stone, although we can instead use an alternative material. We can make your path as functional or as pretty as you need it to be. And we always ensure they are goat-friendly!
      </p>
      <h3>
        Driveways
      </h3>
      <p>
        You park your car, your truck, or your dogsled in your driveway, so it’s no big deal, right? Wrong. You are so wrong. So completely wrong. So wrong it’s not even funny. Ha ha ha! That is me laughing at how wrong you are, but in a sarcastic way because you aren’t very funny and don’t make me really laugh. Let me explain. The driveways we make are like thrones for your transportation, if thrones were quite large, completely flat, really hard, and had cars on top of them.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Retaining Walls
      </h3>
      <p>
        What’s that? You have too much soil on your slope and it’s making a huge mess? You, my friend, need a retaining wall. It’s a, um, wall that retai…, ok, holds the soil back so it doesn’t slide down the, uh, hill. That’s right. Come to us for the best holdy-hilly-dirt thingies ever.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Drain Tile Installation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Drain tile systems serve two purposes: water removal away from the house and water injection into the soil foundation during drought. Drought conditions can cause the soil of your foundation to shrink, causing foundation and footer to fall. We come to your home, evaluate where drain tile is needed and how to pull water away from the wet areas. And then we tell the next guy you hire how to do it, because there is no way you are paying us enough to work on that toxic waste dump.
